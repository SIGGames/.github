## Fork the repository

To contribute to a SIGGames project, you will need to fork the repository. To do this, click the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the repository page.

Before making any changes, you will need to create a new branch for your work. To do this, run the following command in your terminal:

## Make your changes

Now that you have created a new branch, you can make your changes to the project. You can make changes to the code, documentation, or any other files in the repository.

## Push your changes

After making your changes, you will need to push them to your forked repository. To do this, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```

## Create a pull request

Once you have pushed your changes to your forked repository, you can create a pull request to merge your changes into the main repository. To do this, click the "New pull request" button on the main repository page.
